# Ball speed & spin rate calculator
 
Provided the footage was shot with a high enough resolution and frame rate to discern the ball's rotation from 1 frame to the next, and we know what that frame rate is, we can determine the ball's spin rate in RPM (revolutions per minute)

By estimating the distance a shot traveled in all 3 dimensions, and we know what that frame rate is, we can determine the ball's speed in MPH (miles per hour)

This script just spares us the arithmetic...
